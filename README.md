# Premium-Chocolate-Analysis

Determine which characteristics are shared by premium chocolate bars 


The following analysis is my entry for the Premium Chocolate Analysis competition hosted by DataCamp. The details are as follows;

You work at a specialty foods import company that wants to expand into gourmet chocolate bars. Your boss needs your team to research this market to inform your initial approach to potential suppliers. After finding valuable chocolate bar ratings online, you need to explore if the chocolate bars with the highest ratings share any characteristics that could help you narrow your search for suppliers (e.g., cacao percentage, bean country of origin, etc.)
